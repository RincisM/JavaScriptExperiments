JavaScript Experiments


1. [This Program is inside the Scripts Folder with the name isPhone.js]
Write and test a function named isPhone that will take a single parameter 
and return true if that argument represents a phone number and false 
otherwise. This function should check that the entire value passed as an 
argument is a phone number with nothing preceding or following it. It 
should accept phone numbers in the following formats:
• XXXXXXXXXX ,
• XXX-XXX-XXXX ,
• XXX XXX XXXX ,
• (XXX) XXX-XXXX , and
• (XXX)XXX-XXXX


2. [This Program is inside the Scripts Folder with the name containsPhone.js]
Write and test a function named containsPhone that will take a single 
parameter and return true if that argument contains a phone number and 
false otherwise. This function should ignore anything that may precede 
or follow the phone number in the passed string value. It should accept
phone numbers in the same formats as the previous step.


3. [This Program is inside the Scripts Folder with the name extractColorNumber.js]
Write and test a function named extractColorNumber that will take a 
single parameter and return the first valid CSS color specifier it finds in 
that value as a string converted and normalized to the format #HHHHHH 
(with any letters converted to uppercase). It should identify and extract 
CSS color specifiers in the following formats:
• #HHHHHH,
• #HHH,
• rgb(D, D, D), and
• rgb(P%, P%, P%)
where H is any valid hexadecimal digit, D is any decimal value between 
0 and 255 (inclusive), P is any decimal value between 0 and 100 
(inclusive), and the single spaces after the commas are optional. If the 
passed parameter contains no color specifier at all, or if the first thing 
that might be interpreted as a color specifier within the string is not a 
valid color specifier, this function should return a value of null.


4.Create a simple calculator which performs three more calculations other 
than the basic arithmetic calculations. You must use an external 
JavaScript file. Name your files calculator.html and calculator.js.


5.Create a "To-do list application". Through this 
application you should be able to add the task. Once you add the task to 
be get updated in the task list and you click on the next task button the 
task must be removed from the list and to be displayed in the next task. 
You must use an external JavaScript file. Name your files
